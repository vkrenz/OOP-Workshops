The main difficulty I faced while completing this workshop is getting to understand header files better. I had an understanding of them
going in but had a hard time understand how the puzzle pieces fit together. Completing this workshop helped me understand and grasp the
idea much better. Overall, I just have a better understanding of modular programming and what it's purpose is. Also, namespaces was very confusing for me going in but now I understand that it’s a good practice to use especially if you’re working on a team project that would involve more than one namespace, usually involving the same functions and structs, and what not. This workshop helped me get a better understand of how to organize my code efficiently and neatly, and how to compile them individually and link them all together to run in one main file.
